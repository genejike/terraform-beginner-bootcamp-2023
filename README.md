## semantic versioning 
This PROJECT IS GOING TO UTILISE SEMANTIC VERSIONING 
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH ** eg . `1.0.0`, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
* PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
